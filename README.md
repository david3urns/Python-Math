Python scripts related to basic arithmetic

The math_checker.py is a program used to check basic arithmetic, and was done as a project a few years ago with a foster kid of ours who was interested in coding, so I thought this would be a good project to work on him with to get him started. The goal was to make it interesting and practical, so he could use it to check his own homework, and it was written so that the program doesn't provide him the answer.

I wrote the quiz program as a follow on to help him get more proficient with math. It allows the user to select single digit or double digit problems and will keep track of how many correct answers they get, divide it against the total and give them a percentage correct.
